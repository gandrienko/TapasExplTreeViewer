Characteristics of the prunned models

Cardio 3 classes
1700 data instances

Prunned 1: 
  10 unique rules
  6 features
  33 conditions, from 2 to 5 per rule
  aggregation with rho=0.95 down to 0.70 (same results): 
    9 rules with 27 conditions, 1 to 5 per rule 
	1 union rule (unites 2 rules) with 1 condition, CC=1, accuracy=0.985 (based on the 1700 instances available)
  aggregation with rho=0.65 down to 0.60:
    9 rules with 27 conditions, 2 to 5 per rule
	1 union rule (unites 2 rules) with 3 conditions, CC=0.667, accuracy=0.97
  multi-step aggregation, rho from 0.95 down to0.60, step 0.05: same result as for rho=0.95
	
    
	
Prunned 2:
  6 unique rules 
  4 features
  15 conditions, 2 to 3 per rule
  aggregation failed (tried several values of rho down to 0.6)

Prunned 3:
  4 unique rules
  3 features
  8 conditions, 2 per rule
  aggregation failed  
  
Prunned 4:
  3 unique rules
  2 features
  5 conditions, 1 to 2 per rule
  aggregation not possible - each rule predicts a distinct class
  
Cardio 10 classes
1700 data instances

Prunned 1:
  14 unique rules
  10 features
  59 conditions, 2 to 6 per rule
  aggregation with rho>0.65 fails
  aggregation with rho=0.65 and rho=0.60 (same result):
    13 rules with 54 conditions
	1 union rule (unites 2 rules) with 1 condition, CC=0.667, accuracy=0.945 (based on the 1700 instances available)
	
Prunned 2:
  7 unique rules, predict 7 out of 10 classes, classes 4,5,6 are missing
  5 fetures
  21 conditions, 2 to 4 per rule
  aggregation not posssible - each rule predicts a distinct class

Prunned 3:
  5 rules, predict 5 out of 10 classes, classes 3,4,5,8,9 are missing
  3 features
  12 conditions, 2 to 3 per rule
  aggregation not posssible - each rule predicts a distinct class
  
Prunned 4:
  4 rules, 4 out of 10 classes (1,2,6,7)
  2 features
  8 conditions, 2 per rule
